Acidity Analysis

The wine acidity code analyzes and predicts wine quality using machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest). It includes data balancing with SMOTE, feature scaling, and model training to evaluate accuracy. Key insights, such as optimal acidity levels for high-quality wine, are identified through feature importance and synthetic data predictions.

Residual Sugar and Alcohol Analysis - Danita Charles

This analysis uses a Clustering Algorithm to analyze if the physicochemical properties of residual sugar and alcohol level contribute to specific quality scores of red wines. The code uses K-means for the initial analysis, then optimization using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
