Acidity Analysis

The wine acidity code analyzes and predicts wine quality using machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest). It includes data balancing with SMOTE, feature scaling, and model training to evaluate accuracy. Key insights, such as optimal acidity levels for high-quality wine, are identified through feature importance and synthetic data predictions.

Residual Sugar and Alcohol Analysis - Danita Charles

This analysis uses a Clustering Algorithm to analyze if the physicochemical properties of residual sugar and alcohol level contribute to specific quality scores of red wines. The code uses K-means for the initial analysis, then optimization using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 

Sulfur Analysis

The Free and Total Sulfur Dioxide code was to analyze and predict what levels should be considered when choosing a red wine. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were used to this end. Ultimatly Random Forest was the most useful in making a respectable conclusion as to what those levels should be.

This code was written by myself, Bryan Thomas, my work Ai Maharal, with charting help from my teammate Rebekkah.


Density, Ph Analysis
Density and pH of high quality wines were also analyzed using logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models, balanced with SMOTE to accommodate a limited high quality wine volume within the dataset. Ultimately, there was insufficient data to use density and pH as predictors of high quality wine.
