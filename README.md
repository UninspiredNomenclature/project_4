Acidity Analysis
The wine acidity code analyzes and predicts wine quality using machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest). It includes data balancing with SMOTE, feature scaling, and model training to evaluate accuracy. Key insights, such as optimal acidity levels for high-quality wine, are identified through feature importance and synthetic data predictions.
